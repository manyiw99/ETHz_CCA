# Cloud Computing Architecture(23Spring)
Summary of [23Spring ETHz Cloud Computing Architecture course](https://systems.ethz.ch/education/courses/2023-spring/cloud-computing-architecture.html)

## Introduction of Cloud Computing
### 1. What's cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of compute and storage resources on-demand, to offer:
- High performance
- Cost efficiency (economies of scale)
- Flexibility, elasticity
- High availability

### 2. Two types of cloud:
- Private clouds: limited to a single organization, e.g., enterprises have their own cloud facilities
- Public clouds: can be used by multiple organizations, e.g., public cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud rent hardware/software services on demand to the public

### 3. Evolution of cloud computing
- Cloud 1.0: Virtualization: Enable multiple users to share hardware
- Cloud 2.0: Hardware on demand: Rent virtual machines by the hour (or second) from public cloud provider
- Cloud 3.0: “Serverless computing”: Cloud provides an abstraction of compute and storage services, not servers
